##  Project Overview

This project analyzes Real GDP Growth trends from 1980 to 2029 using data sourced from the **International Monetary Fund (IMF)**. The objective is to assess historical economic performance, identify countries with stable GDP growth, and detect significant anomalies like economic booms or recessions.

##  Dataset Description

- **Source:** International Monetary Fund (IMF)
- **Size:** ~68 KB
- **Features:**
  - Annual GDP growth rates (in %) for multiple countries
  - Historical data from 1980 to 2023
  - Projected data from 2024 to 2029
  - Includes missing values for some countries/years

> **Sample Structure:**

| Country     | 1980  | 1981  | ... | 2028  | 2029  |
|-------------|-------|-------|-----|--------|--------|
| Albania     | 2.70  | 5.70  | ... | 3.50   | 3.50   |
| Algeria     | -5.40 | 3.00  | ... | 2.10   | 2.10   |

##  Project Objectives

1. Explore Real GDP Growth data for 1980–2029.
2. Identify the **two most stable economies** over the 50-year period.
3. Detect **anomalies or outliers** in GDP performance.
4. Provide **managerial insights** and policy-level recommendations.

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repo and open in Jupyter or any notebook editor.
2. Install required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run `GDP Forecast.ipynb` to visualize trends and forecast future growth.

##  Future Scope

- Integrate **Macroeconomic Indicators** like CPI, inflation, and employment rates.
- Use **LSTM/RNN models** for time-series forecasting.
- Develop a **dashboard** using Streamlit or Dash for interactive GDP analysis.
