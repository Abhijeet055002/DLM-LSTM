## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Real GDP Growth trends from 1980 to 2029 using data sourced from the **International Monetary Fund (IMF)**. The objective is to assess historical economic performance, identify countries with stable GDP growth, and detect significant anomalies like economic booms or recessions.

## 📊 Dataset Description

- **Source:** International Monetary Fund (IMF)
- **Size:** ~68 KB
- **Features:**
  - Annual GDP growth rates (in %) for multiple countries
  - Historical data from 1980 to 2023
  - Projected data from 2024 to 2029
  - Includes missing values for some countries/years

> **Sample Structure:**

| Country     | 1980  | 1981  | ... | 2028  | 2029  |
|-------------|-------|-------|-----|--------|--------|
| Albania     | 2.70  | 5.70  | ... | 3.50   | 3.50   |
| Algeria     | -5.40 | 3.00  | ... | 2.10   | 2.10   |
